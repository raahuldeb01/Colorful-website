                        Hey shree, From the moment I first saw you at that wedding a few months ago, my entire world shifted. It
                        was as if time slowed down, and everything else faded into the background. I never believed in
                        love at first sight until that day‚Äîuntil I saw you. Your smile, your presence‚Äîit was like a
                        beautiful dream that I didn‚Äôt want to end. I couldn‚Äôt help but keep glancing at you, hoping
                        you‚Äôd notice me, too.

                        After that night, I couldn‚Äôt get you out of my mind. I kept replaying those fleeting moments,
                        wishing I had said something, done something, to let you know how I felt. It was strange how
                        someone I barely knew could leave such an imprint on my heart. I knew I had to find a way to
                        reach you, to see if that magical feeling could be real.

                        When we finally started talking, it was like discovering a new world‚Äîone filled with endless
                        possibilities and unspoken dreams. You surprised me with your kindness, your sense of humor, and
                        the way you seem to understand me without me having to say much at all. With every word, every
                        laugh, I found myself falling even harder. You brought light into my days, and soon, I couldn‚Äôt
                        imagine a day without hearing from you.

                        There‚Äôs something incredibly special about you. You‚Äôre the person I think of first in the
                        morning and the last before I fall asleep. You make me feel like the best version of myself‚Äîlike
                        I‚Äôm truly seen, truly valued. I never knew love could feel so effortless, so natural, and yet so
                        overwhelming at the same time.

                        Now, you‚Äôve become the center of my world‚Äîthe one who makes my heart race, who makes me feel
                        alive in ways I never thought possible. You are the calm to my chaos, the smile to my worries,
                        the dream I never want to wake up from. I want to share every sunrise and sunset with you, every
                        laugh and every tear.

                        All I know is that I want to be by your side. I want to make you smile, hold your hand, and
                        remind you every single day how much you mean to me. I want to be the one you count on, the one
                        who makes your days a little brighter and your nights a little warmer.

                        I love you, and I want to love you more every day. I want to build a life with you‚Äîfull of joy,
                        support, and endless love. You are my heart, my happiness, my everything.

                        Will you be mine, not just for now, but for always? üíñ <br>

                        <strong>Shree, I am not good at proposing and stuff. Soo this is the way i propose you and the answer you can
